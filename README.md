# shortify

[browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify) transform which can
shorten require paths with defined aliases.

## Installation

Install with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install shortify

## Preview

Call shortify with your alias hash and pass it to the `transform` method of
your browserify instance.

```
var shortify = require('shortify');

var builder = browserify({ entries: ['app.js'] });
var transform = shortify({ foo: '../../foo' });

builder.transform(transform).bundle().pipe(yourwritestream);
```

Then require your modules will be rewritten from:

```
var bar = require('foo/bar');
var baz = require('foo/../baz');

```

to:

```
var bar = require('../../foo/bar');
var baz = require('../../foo/../baz');

// your module.exports source code
```

You can do the same with `import` in ES6:

```
import bar from "foo/bar";
import baz from "foo/../baz";

// compiles to:
import bar from "../../foo/bar";
import baz from "../../foo/../baz";
```

Main motivation behind this is that you can keep the > 80 character per
line limit when requiring templates, configuration, ... files shared
between your server and client environment.

## Testing

Run `npm test` to build the file and and run the Mocha tests defined in
`opt/test/index.js`.
